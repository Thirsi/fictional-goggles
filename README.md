# Godot VR
A Godot VR training platform.

Over the last three years, I've been part of a small team working on a VR training platform for a local factory. Unfortunately, due to a downturn in the factory's business, the entire development team has been laid off. I've been brainstorming ideas for a new project to keep my skills sharp and experiment with different concepts. While I could use the platform we created in Unreal 5, it raises concerns about who owns the IP. To address this, I'm considering implementing a similar, but not identical system in the Godot game engine. Why Godot? It sidesteps the IP issue since none of our existing systems will work in this engine. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to delve into an emerging game engine that is entirely open-source.
